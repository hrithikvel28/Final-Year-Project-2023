Project Title:Distributed Generation Systems Using Renewable Energy Sources

Project Started:January 2023 

Project Completed:May 2023

Project Description:Associated with the Department Of Electrical And Electronics Engineering (EEE) from Velammal College Of Engineering And Technology (VCET), Madurai.
A new, hybrid integrated topology, fed by photovoltaic cell (PV), wind energy and fuel cell (FC) sources suitable for distributed generation applications, is proposed. It works as an uninterruptible power source that is able to feed a certain minimum amount of power into the grid under all conditions.
